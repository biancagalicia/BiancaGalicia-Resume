        <p class="lead mb-4">Enter bio here<br> I‚Äôm a first-generation sophomore at UC Riverside. My major is in Education and I plan to pursue speech pathology as my career. I come from a low-income Hispanic family, who grew up in South Central. As an only child, my parents look up to me to be the first one to get a degree and become successful. Although it's a lot of pressure, I use it as a motivation to keep me going. 
Once I moved from LA to Riverside, I decided to hunt for a job. Dining Services were hiring a lot of freshmen and so I dived to secure a part-time job. It was my first job and taste of my own money. I developed a second perspective of the food industry. I learned how it felt to be on the other side of the counter and not only have the customer point of view. It taught me customer service skills and how to work under pressure. Furthermore, responsibility and teamwork played a dominant role on the job. I met co-workers with similar backgrounds and others who are completely different. Overall, it's been a good experience learning from each other and gaining skills at the same time.
<br>

        Enter bio here<br>I‚Äôve always been interested in learning how to cook. Luckily, the cooking club opened during my senior year and it was the opportunity to get a well-rounded experience. I met new people who had the same passion to learn how to run a kitchen and ended up positively impacting my social life. We were able to get a hands-on experience and learn how to prepare meals from scratch. Our instructor provided all the support and guidance needed to succeed in this environment. We got a sense of community, working together as a team to prepare a meal for all of us to enjoy at the end. Towards the end of the year, we entered a cooking competition with other schools. We took the win! Personally, it was a huge accomplishment because we started without knowing much to having the confidence to compete with other students. I walked out knowing I was well-prepared to cook a meal when I left for college. 
<br>

        Enter bio here<br>During the beginning of my senior year, I joined the Associated Student Body (ASB). I knew the majority of the people in the group but I was still able to meet a few more people. Since the majority knew the passion I had to make our school better and make the best of our last year, I was voted as Vice President. As promised, we were able to embed more senior activities and promote more awareness about global issues such as global warming to the school. It was a lot of work to try to get your team to work together, especially when not everyone was on the same page. But we learned to work as a team and have each others back. Moreover, we learned to balance our academics with our outside activities and not let ‚Äúsenioritis‚Äù get to us. It was a learning experience taking on a lead and at the same time preparing myself for college applications.
